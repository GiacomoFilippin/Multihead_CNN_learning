step one:   get familiar with stuff.
            understand where stuff is
            decide what we're gonna use as features
    examples:   classifying sub-genres alone or with intermediate top genres estimation
                maybe something with tags?

step two: start implementation, try to work around the issue of dimensionality
            possible to process tracks without unzipping the file (?)
            function that iterates, saves the spectrogram in a file named as the song
                (or else in a data dict with all songs together)
